### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a senior software developer with over 3.5+ years of experience, I specialize in PHP and have a wealth of experience working with Laravel and CodeIgniter. I am also well-versed in MySQL, WordPress, JavaScript, jQuery, and Vue.js, making me a versatile and skilled developer.

I have a Mechatronic Engineering degree and have always had a passion for coding, which led me to study abroad in Slovenia through the Erasmus+ program. As a fluent English speaker, I am able to effectively communicate with international teams.

Currently, I am a resident of Istanbul, Turkey, and am working at Massive Bio, an AI-driven platform connecting cancer patients to bio-pharmaceutical clinical trials. I have been with the company since April 2019 and have been able to make valuable contributions to the team.

I am a determined and motivated professional with a proven track record of delivering complex projects on time and within budget. I have a natural ability to solve problems and am dedicated to staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies.

I am skilled in Agile and Scrum software development methodologies and am comfortable taking on a leadership role when necessary. I am also a team player and enjoy working in fast-paced, deadline-driven environments. I am confident that I can make a positive impact on any organization I join.
